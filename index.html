                Hey, I'm Ryan! I'm a recent graduate of SBCS where I completed my BSc in Computing and Information Systems 
                with the University of Greenwich.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I'm a novice web developer, with most of my experience being university projects and online learning, up until recently where I  was commissioned to developed
                a social media-like blogging site called <a href="https://www.sincerelyme-tt.com/">Sincerely, Me.</a><br/><br/>

                I'm always eager to learn and develop my skills however I can, with some of my more recent endeavors in learning being
                brushing up on my JavaScript to try frameworks like React and Node!

              I am capable, hardworking, resourceful and creative with most of these traits being reflected in the code I write and use. 
              I do not scare easy and tend to take on very ambitious projects, with my final project at the degree level being testament to that.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Out of my entire year, I was the only one brave enough to step outside the box and try something new!

              I work well in groups or teams. I always try to be friendly, approachable and accommodating. I help others with their coding problems
              and even teach others based on what I know. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I am also very interested in learning and trying new things! My current endeavors include: Learning Android to a higher level, Machine Learning and Game Development using Unity!

                    This project was done based around my father's business. He works as an industrial electrician and for my final project
                    at the degree level, I decided to try automating his business process. For this I had to do a series of interviews with
                    both my mother and father to get an idea of the business process and model it as a website.

                    volunteer-type application with the premise of getting others involved with volunteering activities. This application was 
                    built partially in Android as its own project and built complete in Apache Cordova, both using Regular Expressions for their validation.

                     The above screenshots more or less encompass the primary functionality of the application. From left to right, starting
                     at the top, the app start screen opens up the main menu from which a user can do any of the activity related tasks.

                     <br/>
                     A user can create a new activity, view the details of said activity and even search for an activity by the activity name. 
                     All of this storage functionality is implemented using SQLite, a lightweight, single table, SQL-based database that is stored
                     on the user's device. The database itself is very limited, but can perform a basic CRUD very efficiently, the storage volume
                     is low, but for a mobile device that much is expected.

                    to finding people to hire as "sitters", for instance a petsitter, babysitter or housesitter. 
                    <br/>
                    The site itself was developed using PHP, SQL (mysqli), JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Regular Expressions (for validation) and featured some more advanced usage of PHP 
                    and web development; pagination, captcha, cookies, automated emails and filtered searches. The developed site was also
                    developed to pass W3C standards using HTML5 elements. Some of the functionality
                    developed for this application includes:

                     The account creation for this application is similar to other modern sites. The assignment required us to develop
                     this registration to allow for a Captcha (an open-source PHP captcha generation script called Securimage was used for this)
                     , an automated email system that was implemented using PHPMailer (another class that was implemented into the system)to generate
                     the verification email. 
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Within the verification email the generated verification code would be provided and the user could
                     enter it to verify their account. This will give the user "consumer" status in the system, but they can apply for "sitter" status
                     through another form.

                     Sitters have their own registration that's only available after the member registration, this was a stipulation of the
                     assignment brief. But from left to right, you can see the sitter registration form, the sitter dashboard, the sitter posting form available on the Sitter dashboard 
                     and the listing of all a sitter's posts with edit and delete functions.

                     The sitter dashboard is incomplete, but this was due
                     to time constraints on the assignment. The dashboard was a bit of "Scope Creep" as the assignment did not ask for it, but 
                     it was still done to add some order to the sitter-side of the application.

                    This project was done as part of a group development assignment. The focus of this site was to create an 
                    information sharing site specific to a fictional institution called eTutor. The site was to be made in similar fashion
                    to applications such as Moodle or Canvas, for lecturers to connect to students, share information and for students to network. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    While not on the same level as the previously stated applications, this eTutor application satisfied the needs of the assignment
                    very well. The site itself was built using PHP, SQL (mysqli), Bootstrap, JavaScript and Regular Expressions (for validation). In terms of
                    functionality:

                     the tutor dashboard has some searching/sorting facilites for students and a listing of all the interactions 
                     a tutor has with their students, and lastly the admin dashboard is simply an overview of all students with functionality
                     to view statistics on some users and even view their dashboard from the admin side. An example of the admin's statistics is shown below:

                     Student allocation, both for singular and multiple students to a tutor was an important part of the system.
                     The same could be said for the re-allocation of students to tutors. For both of these functions, the student
                     would receive an automated email informing them that they were wither allocated or reallocated to a tutor.
                     Similar to the previous project, PHPMailer was used to achieve this functionality.

                This Augmented Reality Tour Guide, (ARTG for short) was done as my final year project during my degree. 
                The premise of the project was to create a mobile application that would aid in helping others learn about 
                Trinidad and Tobago's history by using Augmented Reality to make learning more exciting. More than that, 
                this project was to be a gambit in trying to diversify Trinidad and Tobago's tourism to adopt a concept
                 known as Urban Tourism which promotes tourism of urban environments, old historical structures and so on to 
                 improve off-season tourism experiences.

                This project was a pure solo project. Start to finish I handled the research, planning, design, development, 
                testing and documentation. This degree and the previous diploma ensured that the students were trained as full-stack 
                developers, capable of doing everything for a project from start to finish. </p>
                
                <p class="modaltext">
                During this project I did the preliminary research ranging from using research papers to validate the project idea, 
                doing literature reviews and so on to gain an idea of what the project may encompass and the technology required.
                Subsequent to this, the project was developed following a hybridized development methodology using Scrum, Evolutionary 
                Prototyping, DSDM and JAD Sessions. </p>
                
                <p class="modaltext">
                The lecturers encouraged us to use hybrid methodologies that suited the project over simply using a single one, 
                as it may not be sufficient. During the project I did the designs, front-end, back-end, database, testing, user-testing, 
                JAD Sessions and the documentation. </p>

                With developing the system, I decided to go with some more modern technologies as compared to the 
                suggested technologies that came up during my research. Around the time I was building this application, 
                I found that various Augmented Reality companies were creating plugins that could be used in different development
                applications. One of those companies was Wikitude and the application was Unity. 
                </p>

                <p class="modaltext">
                Unity was a perfect choice for development with its stable environment, plethora of online support, ease-of-use and cross-platform development, making it possible for the application to be made for iOS or Android. This application was made using Android, forcing the use of Gradle for building the application onto the phone.

                <p class="modaltext">
                During development I decided to use MySQL for the database, but I was encouraged by my lecturers to use Firebase since I wasn't storing much data. So my technology stack became:

                  This project was made with the specific intention of trying to create a project that addresses a problem in Trinidad and Tobago's tourism, where little is done to promote off-season tourism that isn't based in Carnival, Summer or Christmas

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  There exists a market of people who prefer to travel in off-seasons due to cheaper rates and accomodation, but the lack of facilities to appeal to this group make it difficult for some to enjoy their time during their travels. This application sought to diversity tourism to appeal to the concept of Urban Tourism to encourage tourism of historical sites and location

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  To put them back on the map and potentially add value to them and the importance of their conservation as key pieces of Trinidad and Tobago's history. The outcome of this project was simply to create a mobile application that used augmented reality to make Urban Tourism viable and to try and add flair to a typically boring point of conversation such as history. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  The premise was simply to use AR to show images, videos and general augmented media of various historical locations as they looked in the past and compare them to what is seen today. Including small, bite-sized descriptions of the historical location to cover the major aspects of that location's history. There was the attempt to use some gamification through XP points every time you visit a new location and such to encourage exploration but this did not happen due to time restrictions on the project.

                      Some of the coolest features of the application included the different forms of AR employed by the application. The ARTour guide makes use of Object, Marker and Location-based AR. The Object and Marker AR was implemented through the Wikitude SDK made use of though Unity.

                      The location based AR on the other hand was done from scratch in a sort of haphazard way. This was due to the Wikitude SDK not supporting LBAR (Location-Based AR) at the time of development, it was only after development did support release for that functionality. Some examples of the different forms of AR are below:

                     The login functionality of the application was done using Firebase's authentication. This login was not coded out manually
                     like all the other login screens of the previous applications I have built. This login simply takes in the email and password
                     of a user and sends it to Firebase's authentication server through the web, the server's response will determine if the user
                     is logged in or not. Successful login provides a token and the ID of the user stored in Firebase, while unsuccessful login
                     returns nothing. 
                     
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     
                     As part of successfully logging into the system, the app also checks the user's current GPS position. Augmented reality content for a specific location is curated beforehand and 
                     uploaded to a web server, if the user is in that specific location, as part of the login functionality the app will connect
                     to the web server and download that set of curated content and load it into the app. This content is destroyed on app close. 
                     The second and third screenshots display this functionality. 
                     
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     
                     This way a user can view a large amount of AR content without bloating their devices with unnecessary files.

                     This system also contained some commenting ability that is available on the canvas screen. From the screenshots above, 
                     the system allows a user to create a comment for a specific AR object, the system is not perfect and does have some
                     problems with its scrolling but it is functional. All comments made are stored and pulled from Firebase, and are ordered 
                     according to Firebase's built in ascending sort done on the date and time of the comments.

                <h5 class="modaltext">Challenges and Hurdles</h5>
                <p class="modaltext">
                  There were a lot of hurdles during development. Some of them stemming from my inexperience with C# and Unity, 
                  since I had never used the technologies before. But most of the hurdles laid with Firebase and trying to both 
                  post and receive data to/from the server. 
                </p>

                <p class="modaltext">
                Particularly for loading comments for a AR feature, it was difficult to get the data and display it without 
                encountering UI issues and in some cases not being able to load any comments in some cases. There was also the 
                difficulty of emulating the LBAR for the application. My solutions for these problems were very "novel" or unorthodox really. 
                </p>

                <ul class="modaltext">
                      <li>
                        With Firebase, I was able to follow a guide to find a way to collect all the comments from a collection, 
                        they had to be serialized using an external unity package and then they were placed into objects where the 
                        data was accessible through dot notation. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        This was a massive headache, sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. It turned out that the problem I was 
                        encountering was primarily a Firebase problem where some collections could not be accessed at all unless there was 
                        a "dummy" value inside the collection. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        So, to write or read comments the dummy value had to be manually made in Firebase for the app to be able to connect and perform its job. 
                        Why this happens eludes me and my colleagues more versed in Firebase to this day. 
                      </li>
                        <br/>
                      <li>
                        A major piece of difficulty laid with the LBAR, a key selling point of the app was the various types of AR employed 
                        by the app, but with the Wikitude SDK not natively supporting LBAR at the time of development a workaround had to be 
                        employed.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Unity naturally has location-based services built-into the development environment through various classes. I can't 
                        specifically remember the method used for this, but effectively once a user is within a specific range of 
                        latitude/longitude values a prompt would appear on screen asking the user if they would like to see some information 
                        about the location they're in.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Clicking yes would cause an image to appear on screen where a raycast was used to emulate a "tap" event where once 
                        the ray collided with the object (image), a new scene would open that would contain a short blurb about the historical 
                        location the user is currently in as well as some supporting images/media and commenting etc.

                  <h5 class="modaltext">What I Learned</h5>
                  <p>
                    I learned a lot when it came to doing this project. Previous to this application the primary experience I had with 
                    development was with some minor mobile application and web development using older technologies like PHP. Some of 
                    the best things I learned were:
                  </p>

                  <ul class="modaltext">
                    <li>How good it is to step out of your comfort-zone when it comes to technologies and try new things, C# is an amazing language to develop in and is very succinct when it comes to development. Compared to Java it is atleast!</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Unity is an amazing IDE, everything just works straight out of the box!</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Starting early definitely paid off with this project, I needed time to build the application but more importantly I needed time to fail. There were a lot of unknowns for some of the functionality, some of it I had to build from scratch like the LBAR, Commenting and Liking functionality. Without starting early and managing my time as good as I could the project would have failed.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Taking breaks is important, I burned myself out often throughout the 9 months of this project. Starting from scratch, researching, designing, building, testing. It took lots of time and the lack of breaks almost damaged the quality of this project significantly due to fatigue. </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Finding tutorials helps a lot when you're working with technology that you've never used before without tutorials for Firebase and Unity's use of AR I would be stumped!</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Making your own hybridized methodology is great if you're really focused on producing a quality product. But it comes at the sacrifice of needing to document everything appropriately, which tool up an unfortunately large amount of time. </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Firebase is not very good. It caused me a lot of headache during development which could have been avoided if I used a database like MySQL or perhaps MongoDB. I still never understood the bug with Firebase, but outside of that the inability to read data from firebase for the commenting slowed down development significantly. Though, its authentication service did save some time during development!</li>

                This project was one of the first jobs I did outside of my degree, and it really took a while to build! 
                This site was made as a blogging site for a therapist who wanted a safe space for her clients to open up 
                and talk about their feelings, problems etc. so they could find support in one another. 
                The functionality of this app was very intense, what started as a blog turned into a small social media app!

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  This application was made as part of a commission by a therapist as I said earlier, at first I was just 
                  excited to have a job! Around the time I made this application, I didn't yet receive my transcripts and 
                  such from my university so any work was acceptable for me. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  As time went by though, this project slowly became more and more important to me as I learned how necessary 
                  such an application is during a pandemic. There are many people struggling with anxiety and bouts of depression 
                  facing this pandemic, and this simple application may have helped people to alleviate some of that stress. 
                  I personally know people who struggle with these feelings, myself included so the simple "first job" quickly became sort of a passion project. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  Mental health is often ignored and stigmatized in the Caribbean ecosystem, many people are ashamed to get
                  help but this simple app that allowed people to simply write out their feelings and have a therapist or others 
                  afflicted with the same issues read them and lend support during trying, difficult times. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  The expected outcome of the project was really to create a web application that satisfies the needs of the product 
                  owner, but as time went by the outcome changed to trying to make a strongly made application that could be used to 
                  support people emotionally. As much as I am somewhat inexperienced with development in the real world, my expectation 
                  for this project pushed the simple outcome of "satisfying the client" to trying to build a solid, functional blogging 
                  application with social media-like functions that could truly help someone to find support. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  The initial designs for the application were very minimal, for this application I decided to use scrum as the
                   methodology of choice. A strange choice, given that scrum is usually used in teams but I changed it slightly so 
                   I could make use of the methodology's innate flexibility and responsiveness to change. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  The latter being the major reason why it was chosen. But using scrum, designs were minimal with simple designs 
                  such as a : Use Case Diagram, ERD and Relational Schema being the only things made. Every other piece of design, 
                  from the UI's and placements came through feedback from the product owner and my own know-how with building web 
                  applications. The use of a simple Bootstrap template that was easily editable definitely helped a whole lot with this!
                  </p>

                  <p class="modaltext">
                  These are some of the rough preliminary designs for the application:

                  Other bits of preliminary planning for this application included measuring if site builders like Wordpress, 
                  Joomla, Drupal etc. would be better. But the product owner was very specific in what they wanted, and 
                  I didn't have much experience with site builders so building the app effectively from scratch was the best 
                  I could do. I did some research here and there however, looking up how sites like Penzu and Medium did their 
                  blogging and tried to match their functionality and UI as best I could without plagiarizing their look and feel.

                  There are some areas of the system that I am very proud about when it comes to functionality. 
                  The homepage for instance is a feed of data collected from the database and echoed through a while 
                  loop in a neatly organized, formatted way. </p>
                    
                  <p class="modaltext">This also allows for pagination, which was built using some 
                  code that a lecturer had given me to use back during my time in university. Each item on the home page is 
                  dynamic, it is a small "card" that shows an image if the user attached an image to their post (or none at 
                  all if no images were attached) as well as the title of the post, the user who posted it, date/time and a 
                  read-more button. All of this is made using bootstrap so it is very much mobile accessible.</p>

                    Another area deserving of praise is the blogpost creation. When a user creates a blogpost, the post itself is 
                    divided into several pieces; title, body, postdate, user, tags and images. This information is distributed and
                    stored into different tables where applicable, so tags and images are stored in their own tables while the rest 
                    is stored in a blog table. More than that, the product owned specifically asked that she have the ability to 
                    personally verify blogposts before making them public on the home page.

                    <p class="modaltext">
                    So a table had to be made in the database to keep track of the verification status of a blogpost. A post could exist 
                    in three states: unverified, verified, rejected and the table kept track of this alongside other relevant data. 
                    So, when a post was made by default the post would have an unverified status before the admin
                    -being the therapist- verified or rejected it personally via the admin dashboard.</p>
                    <p class="modaltext"> Rejections would often be 
                    made with a reason that would be communicated to a user via a notification and a notice on their post from 
                    their profile. Verifications on the other hand would be done and the user notified through their notifications.

                <h5 class="modaltext">Challenges and Hurdles</h5>
                <p class="modaltext">
                There were many hurdles in the way during development, most were minor UI issues but some of the more notable hurdles 
                included:
                
                <ul class="modaltext">
                 <li>Arranging the blogposts on the home screen. This was a major hurdle as it wasn't possible to load all of a 
                  blogpost's content onto a single card as a preview.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                  The development of the blogpost creation was another hurdle, there were many smaller things that had to be 
                  done every time a blogpost was made. Storing the main blogpost was simple, but other bits were not so simple. 
                  A blogpost body had to be made using a rich text editor. Quill.js was used at first, but proved to be problematic and 
                  clunky in operation.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>The product owner also specifically requested to have emojis on the site, which Quill.js did not 
                  support natively. Forcing the switch to CKEditor during development which eased up a lot of stress and concerns as this 
                  editor was much easier to make use of than Quill.js and came with the ability to use packages that support functionality 
                  such as emojis.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                  Tags had to be stored in their own table since a user could have up to 5 tags, images as well since a user could have up 
                  to 2. These inserts had to be looped appropriately depending on exactly how many the user added. Subsequent to this, 
                  the verification status of a blogpost also had to be made, as well as a preview and an automated email sent to the admin 
                  whenever a new blogpost had been submitted to for verification.
                  This proved to be a very difficult thing to develop because 
                  of all the smaller, necessary bits and pieces required. But this hurdle was accomplished through taking an approach of using 
                  small, incremental steps to develop the blogging functionality, breaking it down into smaller pieces and working on them one 
                  at a time definitely helped with managing the volume of work surrounding this functionality. 
                  </li>
                  <br/>

                  <li>
                  The deletion functionality was another primary hurdle. I developed the deletion to be a pure php file with no 
                  front-end. This file would simply be called through a post or get and the script would run, delete the user,  
                  their content and redirect them accordingly. If a user called the delete user script from 
                  their account they would be redirected to the login screen post-deletion, if the admin did the delete 
                  then they would be redirected to the admin panel.
                  The difficulty was that user 
                  accounts would not delete properly, without a front-end to do error check messages debugging was difficult. My solution for 
                  this was to to simulate the delete inside phpmyadmin, this helped to resolve many of the issues I was having, which boiled down to
                   syntax errors and foreign key checks that was resolved through proper 
                  ordering of the delete statements. Once that was sorted I made dummy accounts on the system with useless posts and 
                  tested the delete a few times to ensure everything worked as intended.

                </ul>

                <p class="modaltext">
                The system has been developed and is functional, but to my knowledge the product owner has not officially launched the site with her clients. The product owner mentioned promoting the site through their weekly video-talk show but that is the extent of my knowledge on the system's state.

                  <h5 class="modaltext">What I Learned</h5>
                  <p class="modaltext">
                  With developing this application I learnt many lessons, but to keep them short I'll try to summarize:
                  </p>

                  <ul class="modaltext">
                   <li>Research functionality before building it, sometimes theres a package or 
                     external service you can use to make things easier.</li><br> 
                   <li>Project management skills effectively make or break a project, 
                     without self-set deadlines made in accordance with scrum sprints this project would not have ended very well.</li><br>  
                   <li>SQL has some limitations, but I also need to improve my skill with using it so that I can work around them.</li><br>  
                   <li>Documentation should not be skipped, it just makes more work in the end.</li><br>  
                   <li>Using tools like product backlogs and sprint backlogs help to realistically
                      capture how much work could be done within a certain amount of time.</li><br>  
                   <li>Getting user feedback is incredibly important, without user
                     feedback and user testing certain bugs and errors would not have been found.</li><br>  
                   <li>Taking breaks that don't involve using your computer for any period of time is needed.</li><br>  
                   <li>Documenting while you code, in the form of comments and actual written documentation helps a lot.</li><br>  
                   <li>Write your code to be robust from the start, and test
                      every feature as you build it to ensure it works. Including testing for edge cases!</li><br> 
                  </ul>
